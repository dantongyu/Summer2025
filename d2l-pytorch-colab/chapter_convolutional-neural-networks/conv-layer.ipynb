Suffice it to say, convolutions have proven to be an incredibly powerful tool for computer vision, both in biology and in code. As such, it is not surprising (in hindsight) that they heralded the recent success in deep learning.\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","The core computation required for a convolutional layer is a cross-correlation operation. We saw that a simple nested for-loop is all that is required to compute its value. If we have multiple input and multiple output channels, we are  performing a matrix--matrix operation between channels. As can be seen, the computation is straightforward and, most importantly, highly *local*. This affords significant hardware optimization and many recent results in computer vision are only possible because of that. After all, it means that chip designers can invest in fast computation rather than memory when it comes to optimizing for convolutions. While this may not lead to optimal designs for other applications, it does open the door to ubiquitous and affordable computer vision.\n","\n","In terms of convolutions themselves, they can be used for many purposes, for example detecting edges and lines, blurring images, or sharpening them. Most importantly, it is not necessary that the statistician (or engineer) invents suitable filters. Instead, we can simply *learn* them from data. This replaces feature engineering heuristics by evidence-based statistics. Lastly, and quite delightfully, these filters are not just advantageous for building deep networks but they also correspond to receptive fields and feature maps in the brain. This gives us confidence that we are on the right track.\n","\n","## Exercises\n","\n","1. Construct an image `X` with diagonal edges.\n","    1.
