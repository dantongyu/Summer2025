simple operation. It does exactly what its name indicates, aggregate results over a window of values. All convolution semantics, such as strides and padding apply in the same way as they did previously. Note that pooling is indifferent to channels, i.e., it leaves the number of channels unchanged and it applies to each channel separately. Lastly, of the two popular pooling choices, max-pooling is preferable to average pooling, as it confers some degree of invariance to output. A popular choice is to pick a pooling window size of $2 \\times 2$ to quarter the spatial resolution of output.\n","\n","Note that there are many more ways of reducing resolution beyond pooling. For instance, in stochastic pooling :cite:`Zeiler.Fergus.2013` and fractional max-pooling :cite:`Graham.2014` aggregation is combined with randomization. This can slightly improve the accuracy in some cases. Lastly, as we will see later with the attention mechanism, there are more refined ways of aggregating over outputs, e.g., by using the alignment between a query and representation vectors.\n","\n","\n","## Exercises\n","\n","1. Implement average pooling through a convolution.\n","1. Prove that max-pooling cannot be implemented through a convolution alone.\n","1. Max-pooling can be accomplished using ReLU operations, i.e., $\\textrm{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)$.\n","    1. Express $\\max (a, b)$ by using only ReLU operations.\n","    1. Use this to implement max-pooling by means of convolutions and ReLU layers.\n","    1. How many channels and layers do you need for a $2 \\times 2$ convolution? How many for a $3 \\times 3$ convolution?\n","1. What is the computational cost of the pooling layer? Assume that the input to the pooling layer is of size $c\\times h\\times w$, the pooling window has a shape of $p_\\textrm{h}\\times p_\\textrm{w}$ with a padding of $(p_\\textrm{h}, p_\\textrm{w})$ and a stride of $(s_\\textrm{h}, s_\\textrm{w})$.\n","1. Why do you expect max-pooling and average pooling to work differently?\n","1. Do we need a separate minimum pooling layer? Can you replace it with another operation?\n","1. We could use the softmax operation for pooling. Why might it not be so popular?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8a37fa6a","metadata":{"origin_pos":44,"tab":["pytorch"],"id":"8a37fa6a"},"source":["[Discussions](https://discuss.d2l.ai/t/72)\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"required_libs":[],"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
